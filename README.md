This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error involving type mismatches. The `greeter` function expects a single string argument, but an array of strings is passed to it. This results in a compilation error. The solution shows how to correctly handle the array to avoid the type mismatch.  This is a good example to understand TypeScript's type system and how to handle potential errors early in the development process.
